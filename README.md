This project was the final assignment for the **Design of Intelligent Agents** course, where we implemented AI search algorithms to autonomously guide the *Perseverance Rover* across Mars' surface, successfully navigating challenging terrain and reaching the base of a crater.


In this project, we leveraged **SimpleAI** to implement search algorithms like BFS, UCS, and A*, while developing Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing algorithms from scratch. To aid in real-time analysis and debugging, we used heatmaps to visualize both the roverâ€™s path and the terrain, allowing for precise tracking and performance evaluation throughout the simulation.
